# Book-an-Ambulance
Book an Ambulance is an android-based application to help  the user in booking the public and private ambulance easily in an instant. In public booking (i.e., Rescue1122) user will just generate an emergency alert then the driver will get a request and after  accepting the request ambulance is booked. In private booking the user chooses the disease then  the hospital admin checks the availability of the hospitals, facilities, and doctors after that user will  select the suggested hospital. The user will also select the ambulance size, pick-up point &amp; hospital. Once booked the ambulance user will receive a notification for confirmation of the booking. The  Ambulance driver can view the pick-up and drop location on Google Maps. The users will receive  the contact details of the driver. This is how this Ambulance Booking App will act as a life savior  in times of medical emergency.
